                        <h3>Breaking the Stigma</h3>
                        <p class="stigma paragraph"> Breaking the stigma around mental health starts with open, 
                            honest conversations. Too often, people feel ashamed to 
                            seek help due to misconceptions or fear of judgment. 
                            But mental health is just as important as physical health—it 
                            affects how we think, feel, and live. By talking openly, 
                            we can challenge stereotypes, promote understanding, 
                            and show that seeking support is a sign of strength, not weakness. 
                            Everyone deserves compassion and care, regardless of their struggles. 
                            Together, we can create a society where no one feels alone or silenced. 
                            Let’s break the stigma and prioritize mental well-being for all. 
                            It starts with us.</p>

                        <h3>How mental affects physical</h3>
                        <p class="psychophysiologyparagraph">
                            Mental health and physical health are deeply connected. Chronic stress, 
                            anxiety, and depression can weaken the immune system, increase inflammation,
                             and elevate the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. 
                             Poor mental health can also lead to unhealthy habits like overeating, smoking, 
                             or lack of exercise, further impacting physical well-being. Conversely, physical 
                             conditions like chronic pain or illness can worsen mental health, leading to 
                             feelings of hopelessness or anxiety. Taking care of your mental health improves 
                             overall well-being, energy, and resilience. Prioritizing both mind and body creates 
                             a healthier, more balanced life. They’re equally important to thrive.
